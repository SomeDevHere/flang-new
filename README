# Flang-new

A driver wrapper for Flang/f18

Enables linking with code which expects gfortran symbols and additional flags which are currently not available in the driver as of writing.

This wrapper uses llc, opt, llvm-nm, llvm-objcopy, and clang alongside flang-new.


To use first run `./configure` and use the wrapper script generated at `out/flang`.
